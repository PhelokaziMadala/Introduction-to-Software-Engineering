In module 1, I have learned about software engineering, where engineers design, build, and maintain systems. The SDLC improves efficiency through structured phases. Development follows Waterfall, V-Shape, or Agile methodologies, with functional, non-functional, and regression testing. Requirements gathering uses three specification documents, and project roles divide responsibilities in software development.
Module 2  covers how websites are built with front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for user interaction and back-end for business logic, security, and databases. Effective teamwork leads to better code and fewer bugs. Pair programming helps share knowledge. Tools like version control track changes, while CI/CD and build tools automate deployment. A software stack is a combination of technologies used for development.
Module 3 covers programming languages: interpreted languages run via an interpreter, while compiled languages generate executables. Query, structured, and object-oriented languages are high-level, and assembly is low-level. Code is planned using flowcharts and pseudocode. Identifiers (constants/variables) reference components, and functions are reusable code blocks. Object-oriented programming (OOP) focuses on objects instead of functions
Module 4 covers software architecture as a blueprint for design. Structured design breaks problems into smaller parts, and UML diagrams aid planning. Objects contain data and behaviors, while classes are blueprints. SOA enables loosely coupled services, and distributed systems appear as one. Architectural patterns like microservices offer repeatable solutions. Application environments range from development to production, with cloud or on-premise deployment and key components like firewalls and load balancers.
 Module 5 covers software engineers' roles in designing, developing, and maintaining software. Continuous learning is key, and both hard and soft skills are essential. Thereâ€™s high demand for software engineers, with career paths in technical or managerial roles. Software engineering ethics includes eight principles like public, client, and product responsibilities. Various job titles exist within the field, each with specific skills and responsibilities.
Module 6 is just the final project where
